Hello World Demo

This is a brief and trafiotional Hello world project

In this Python script, I've created a user-friendly interaction by asking for the user's first and last names using the input function. Following that, I've used an f-string to generate a warm greeting that includes their capitalized first and last names. This ensures a polished and professional appearance. The result is then printed to the console, combining a personalized salutation with the classic "Hello, world!" message for a friendly touch.
